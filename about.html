          <p class="aboutP">Hello, I am R. Welcome to my archives. This is a website where I express, store, organize, and share my thoughts. The purpose of this page is to answer some questions
          that any new visitor to the site might have. If you are a new visitor with questions, please see if I have answered them in the following q&a section. If your 
          question is not answered, you may contact me using the email provided in the final section down below.</p>

          <h1 class="aboutH1"><u>Questions & Answers</u></h1>
          <h2 class="aboutH2">Who runs this site?</h2>
            <p class="aboutP">Me, R. I'm just a guy whose first initial is R.</p>
          <h2 class="aboutH2">Why a website?</h2>
            <p class="aboutP">A number of reasons. One big one is that I'm practicing my web-development skills. Everything you see on this website will be coded by me personally
              (So there will definitely be glitches from time to time).  Another reason is the fact that not only will a greater number of people get to see my stuff,
              but hopefully the small niche of people in the world who will actually find it interesting will come across it.</p>
          <h2 class="aboutH2">Why do you call this your "archives"?</h2>
            <p class="aboutP">I thought the word archive had an air of sophistication about it. I also liked the alliteration.</p>
          <h2 class="aboutH2">What kind of stuff is on here?</h2>
            <p class="aboutP">Most of the content is going to be writing. This could include my thoughts on a random topic, my thoughts on a serious topic, analysis of
              a book, a short story, etc. There will be some video and pictures. A podcast is in the works. As my web-development skills improve, hopefully I will add a 
              few games. I've also dedicated one page strictly for book-inspired memes.</p>
